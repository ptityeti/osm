# osm
Contains multiple sub-projects where I try to work a bit with OSM data

1. Walking Routes
=================
Folder walking_routes_analysis
Objective is to work with walking routes. First step is to do quality checks, next step to provide useful information. 
Intially, I was working on a solution in php + MySQL that could run online. Files from this are now in the folder fullphp.
This is more of a legacy folder. More recent work is in the root.
The plan is now to do the treatment in Python with a PostgreSQL (+POSTGIS) db. More geopower! And a good way to get started with pyton for me.
